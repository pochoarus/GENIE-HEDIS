SetDesc: "HERAPDF15 NLO variations of fit parameters.
 The first 8 variations are considered as model errors and should be treated one by one,
 by taking the difference between the variation and the central value,
 and then adding in quadrature all positive (negative) differences to obtain the positive (negative) model error.
 Variations 9 to 12 are the maximal parametrisation variations;
 the largest positive (negative) difference between the variation and the central value is taken
 as the positive (negative) parametrisation error and added in quadrature
 to the model errors to form the parametrisation envelope.
